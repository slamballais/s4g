    <p>
        You look around. <br> 
        You find yourself in the living room of an appartment.<br>
        The other GiS students are there with you in the room.<br>
        How did you get here? None of you seem to remember.<br><br>
        
        You look outside, and notice that you're high up in a skyscrapper.<br>
        You are surrounded by other buildings, but they all seem... void of life.<br>
        You don't recognize the city that you are in, but you also cannot see a single soul.<br>
        An eerie sense looms over the room.<br>
        It dawns onto you that you are in an alternative reality, a figment of someone's imagination.<br><br>
        
        Suddenly, a loud voice starts talking:<br><br>
        
        "Hello, dear students. Welcome to the final challenge.<br>
        The goal of today is simple: find the password, and tell Sander.<br>
        If you succeed, you will be awarded with riches.<br>
        If you fail, however, this alternative reality disappears, and you will leave emptyhanded.<br>
        You find yourself in an appartment.<br>
        Puzzles are hidden around this and other rooms.<br>
        You have to solve the puzzles in order to continue to the next phases.<br>
        Feel free to explore.<br>
        However, time is ticking; you may want to coordinate with your peers, and split up into teams to solve puzzles quicker..."

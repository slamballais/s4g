      You look around. You find yourself in the living room of an appartment. The other GiS students are there with you in the room. 
      How did you get here? None of you seem to remember. You look outside, and notice that you're high up in a skyscrapper.
      You are surrounded by other buildings, but they all seem... void of life. You don't recognize the city that you are in, but
      you also cannot see a single soul. An eerie sense looms over the room. It dawns onto you that you are in an alternative reality,
      a figment of someone's imagination. Suddenly, a loud voice starts talking: "Hello, dear students. Welcome to the final challenge. 
      The goal of today is simple: find the password, and tell Sander. If you succeed, you will be awarded with riches. If you fail, however,
      this alternative reality disappears, and you will leave emptyhanded. You find yourself in an appartment. Puzzles are hidden around this
      and other rooms. You have to solve the puzzles in order to continue to the next phases. Feel free to explore. However, time is ticking;
      you may want to coordinate with your peers, and split up into teams to solve puzzles quicker..."

      Where do you want to go?

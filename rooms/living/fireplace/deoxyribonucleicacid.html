    <p>
        Suddenly, you find yourself in the very core of this place: the Matrix.<br>
        You feel in sync with every bit and byte in the apartment.<br>
        Lines of green symbols cascade down the screen, like a digital waterfall of knowledge.<br>
        It's mesmerizing... until you realize that you left your coffee in the other room.<br>
        You shake your head, trying to refocus.<br>
        What is this strange world, and how did you end up here?<br><br>
        
        A voice crackles through the air: "Welcome, chosen one! You have entered the realm of infinite strings.<br>
        Here, every character counts. Before you lies a dataset of 466 thousand random strings:<br>
        https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt <br>
        Can you find the elusive one that matches the length of the 71414th string in this never-ending sea of text?<br>
        Be careful, though: this sea has no head."<br><br>

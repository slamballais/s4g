        You see, just like myself, messages are often hidden in plain sight...<br>

        "Load in the `phrases.rds` file.<br>
        For each n'th line, extract the n'th character.<br>
        So, for example, for the 4th line, extract the 4th character.<br>

        That number is the hidden word you're looking for."<br>

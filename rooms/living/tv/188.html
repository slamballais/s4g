        "Very good... But you missed a pattern.<br>
        Did you look at the 1000 letters that you extracted?<br>
        They form a pattern, don't they?<br>
        Whose name is that?<br>
        Take that name (not all 1000 characters).<br>
        Now, convert the letters of that name into numbers: A=1, B=2, and so on.<br>
        Take the sum of all those numbers. That is your first number.<br><br>
        
        Next, similarly convert the 1000 sentences from `phrases.rds`.<br>
        For each sentence, calculate the sum of all numbers.<br>
        Then, pick the mode of all sums..." <br>
        
        <strong>Uh, what is the mode?</strong><br><br>
        
        "God, don't you pay attention in statistics class? Week 1? Come on!<br>
        Statistics can save your life.<br>
        Anyway, the mode of all sums is your second number.<br><br>
        
        Finally, sum up the first and the second number.<br>
        That is your hidden word."<br>

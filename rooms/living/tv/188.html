        "Very good... Now, let's try something different.<br>
        In the previous puzzle, you should have noticed that a name emerged.<br>
        Convert the letters of that name to numbers: A=1, B=2, and so on.<br>
        Take the sum of all the numbers. That is your first number."<br><br>
        
        "Next, look at all the phrases in phrases.txt again and apply the same conversion to all of them.<br>
        For each phrase, sum all the numbers.<br>
        Now pick the mode value out of all these sums. That is your second number."<br><br>
        
        "Sum the first and the second number.<br>
        This is your new hidden word."<br>

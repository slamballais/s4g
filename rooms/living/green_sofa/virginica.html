      Huh. An Iris virginica, also known as the great blue flag.<br>
      I wonder what it tastes like...<br>
      You eat the plant.<br>

    <p>
      Nothing.<br><br>
      ...<br><br>
      Suddenly, your vision blurs.<br>
      A million colors flood your mindâ€”reds, greens, purples, and blues. <br>
      You can't help but feel as if you're inside some strange, never-ending rainbow.<br>
      You try to focus, but it's like looking at a kaleidoscope that never stops spinning.<br><br>
      
      From the swirling colors, you hear a faint whisper:<br><br>
      "Find the key in the rainbow by subsetting the Iris dataset...<br>
      Count how many rows have either:<br>
          1. a sepal length of less than 5 AND a petal length of more than 2,<br>
          2. OR a sepal width of less than 3 AND a petal width of more than 2.<br>
      Enter this number into rainbow( ), and grab the 2nd value.<br>
      Remove the hashtag, and your hidden word is ready."<br><br>
      
      You're not entirely sure if you imagined the voice or if the flower is giving you tips.<br>

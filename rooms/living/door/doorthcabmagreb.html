      You open the door.<br>
      Humid, warm air hits your face.<br>
      It doesn't matter, you're finally out of this horrible apartment!<br>
      You look around. You see four doors, presumably other apartments.<br>
      You knock on each door and you shout for help, but the building stays as lifeless as it was.<br>
      You also notice an elevator door. It is already open.<br>
      With your heart pounding in your chest, you enter the elevator...<br>
    </p>

      This is odd... The elevator panel indicates that the 9th floor does not exist.<br>
      Weren't you on a much higher floor?<br>
      You press some other buttons, but the elevator keeps indicating that the floors do not exist.<br>
      It almost seems as though you need to go to a very specific floor...<br>
      Maybe you'll figure out where it is by solving more puzzles?

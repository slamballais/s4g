      You wouldn't say, but I've lost 20% of my couch so far. Ouch. Get it?<br>
      Come on, that has to be the best couch joke you've seen sofa.<br>

      ... Anyway, you look behind the Harold cushion, and you find a piece of paper.<br>
      It contains instructions to get to the next room:<br><br>
      
      "Read in the first_last_digit.txt file (no header)."<br>
      "Each line contains a random combination of letters and numbers."<br>
      "For each line, extract the first and the last number, and combine them into one."<br>
      "Then, sum up all these numbers; the sum can be used as the new hidden word."
      "For example, for the line 'kd1jd8d' the output should be 18 (1 and 8)."<br>
      "For the line 'di8e7du3kdh9' the output is 89 (8 and 9, ignoring 7 and 3)."<br>
      "For the line 'eur7e', the output is 77 (7 and 7, so twice)."<br>

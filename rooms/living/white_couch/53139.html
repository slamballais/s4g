      Well, this is awkward.<br>
      Yes, you did it right.<br>
      However, the instructions still contained a mistake.<br>
      Apparently, you are not supposed to add lines if they only contain one number.<br>
      If they contain one number, they shouldn't be part of the sum.<br>
      So, rewrite your code to skip these lines.<br>
      The sum will be your new hidden word.<br>

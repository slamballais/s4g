    <p>
      Well done. But it seems that the note was only partially correct.<br>
      You see, something seems to have gone wrong when the file was created.<br>
      Some of the numbers were written as words.<br>
      So, "one" should become 1, "two" should become 2, etc...<br><br>
      
      Write a script that replaces the words with numbers (see ?gsub).<br>
      Everything else stays the same (i.e., combine the first and the last digit).<br>
      The sum is your new hidden word.<br>

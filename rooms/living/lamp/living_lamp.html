    <p>
        You approach the lamp, and you realise that the cap is the sorting hat from Harry Potter!<br>
        (If you think this is a weird story, just wait till you see the rest of this game...)<br><br>
        
        The sorting hat starts talking:<br>
        "Hello! More students, I see? Put me on and I'll tell you which Hogwarts House you belong to."<br>
        You are very tempted by this offer due to your nature of being a 2nd year GiS student.<br>
        But you maintain composure. You ask the sorting hat whether it has a puzzle for you.<br><br>
        
        "Hmm puzzle? Puzzle... Why yes, yes, I do have a puzzle for you.<br>
        Actually, if I'm honest, I have been struggling to sort students as of late.<br>
        Can you help me out? I have a backlog of about 1000 students.<br>
        Load in `students_to_sort.rds`.<br>
        I need to sort them into the different houses...<br>
        Children who are brave belong to Gryffindor.<br>
        Children who are kind-spirited belong to Hufflepuff.<br>
        Children who are studious belong to Ravenclaw.<br>
        And children who are cunning belong to Slytherin.<br>
        Sort the children. Then, find which house has the most children.<br>
        The hidden word is the house (lower-case) + the number of children.<br>
        For example, if most children are Slytherin and there are 200, then the hidden word is 'slytherin200'.<br>
        Now go, hurry, while I continue my precious nap".<br><br>
        
        The sorting hat stops responding to you, even when you put it on.<br>

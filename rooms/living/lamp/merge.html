    <p>
        You enter a room and find a singular note, right in the middle.<br>
        It explains how you should build the combined key of the living room.<br>
        Basically, there are four keys that are ordered.<br>
        They are obtained from the television (1), the white sofa (2), the green sofa (3), and the fireplace (4).<br>
        This should create a new number consisting of 8 digits.<br>
        To use the key, you have to take the 8 digits, and place it at the end of the URL of a room that requires a combined key.<br>
        Keep in mind, though... There are multiple rooms that require combined keys.<br>
        So, this key may not work where you think it will...

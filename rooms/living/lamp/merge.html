    <p>
        You enter a room and find a singular note, right in the middle.<br>
        It explains how you should build the key of the living room.<br>
        Basically, each of the other puzzles in the living room give you a number.<br>
        Place those numbers in this order: television (1), white sofa (2), green sofa (3), and fireplace (4).<br>
        This should give you a new 8 digit number.<br><br>
        
        ... What do you do with this new number, you ask? Well, the instructions for that can be found elsewhere.<br>
        Good luck!<br>
        (HINT: WRITE DOWN THE URL SO YOU CAN READ THIS AGAIN LATER, OR COPY THE TEXT!)

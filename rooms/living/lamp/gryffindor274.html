        "Of course, Gryffindor gets most students..."<br><br>
        ... Draco Malfoy?<br><br>
        "What? No, I'm- what? I'm Tom Felton, the actor. You do know Harry Potter is fiction, right?"<br><br>
        Yeah I know, I know... it's just that... Ah, nevermind.<br><br>
        "Anyway, I have a puzzle for you. Let's have a look, shall we?<br>
        In the Harry Potter books (SPOILER ALERT), Tom Marvolo Riddle turns out to be an anagram for I Am Lord Voldemort.<br>
        Harry Potter is full of anagrams.<br>
        So let's try some.<br>
        In the file `anagrams.rds` you will find a data frame with two columns.<br>
        For each row, you have to indicate whether the two words are anagrams of each other.<br>
        You have to count the number of rows that contain anagrams.<br>
        That number is the new hidden word."

    <p>
        You enter the room and find a plate with a... panini?<br>
        ...<br>
        What is this place, I don't get it at all...<br><br>
        
        You sit down and take a bite.<br>
        Instantly, you can feel every single neuron in your brain.<br>
        The pulsing waves, the flow of saltatory conduction, the synaptic transmissions...<br>
        Hidden inside your brain lies the answer to it all, the answer to the universe.<br>
        You dive deeper into this newfound ocean of infinity, and...<br><br>
        
        The feeling goes away.<br>
        God damn it, there isn't much left of your paninfinity sandwich.<br>
        You cram the whole thing in your mouth, meticulously picking every crumb off the plate.<br>
        You look like a seagull desperate to fit every single stolen fry in it's beak.<br>
        Heck, some would say you're sounding similar, too.<br>
        Just like before, your mind expands into infinity.<br>
        This time, the image is much clearer.<br>
        You have to load the `bread` package, and find the function in that package with the shortest name.<br>
        That's the new hidden word.<br>
        Wh-what? How the hell do you do that?<br>

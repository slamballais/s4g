    I didn’t call you down here for tea and biscuits!<br>
    This kitchen is a DISASTER, and these MUPPETS have somehow managed to ruin EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE BLOODY CODE!<br>
    Now, I don't know what kind of amateur hour mess they've cooked up, but it’s stinking up my kitchen like month-old fish!<br>
    Look at this crap, honestly! It's more tangled than spaghetti and about as useful as a chocolate teapot!<br><br>

    You’re supposed to be cleaning this up, so do me a favor and FIND THE ANSWER!<br>
    These clowns have written code so convoluted, it’d take Einstein himself to figure out what the bloody hell they were thinking.<br>

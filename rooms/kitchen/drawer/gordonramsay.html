    I didnâ€™t call you down here for tea and biscuits!<br>
    This kitchen is a DISASTER, and these MUPPETS have somehow managed to ruin EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE BLOODY CODE!<br>

    Look at this crap, honestly! It's more tangled than spaghetti and about as useful as a chocolate teapot!<br><br>

    Youâ€™re supposed to be cleaning this up, so do me a favor and FIND THE ANSWER!<br>

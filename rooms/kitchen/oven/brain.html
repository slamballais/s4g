    <p>
        It's time to count. <br>
        1...<br>
        2...<br>
        3...<br>
        See? It's not that hard.<br>
        Now, you try it.<br>
        Load in `sequence.rds`.<br>
        It contains a series of integers.<br>
        You have to look at places where the same number occurs multiple times.<br>
        For example, let's say the vector was 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1.<br>
        Here, we see that the number 2 repeats 3 times in a row.<br>
        You have to look in sequence.rds what the highest numbers of repeats is one after another.<br>
        That number is the new hidden word.

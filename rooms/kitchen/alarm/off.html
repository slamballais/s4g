        Well, that was annoying.<br>
        I bet the guy who made that alarm is feeling very pleased with himself.<br>
        What a jerk.<br><br>
        
        But wait... You just realised.<br>
        When you pressed the fire alarm, a hidden drawer opened.<br>
        You can find the content of the drawer in the file `loot.rds`.<br>
        Load it into R.<br>
        You notice that each item has a value and a weight.<br>
        We want to take as many items that we can.<br>
        However, we can only carry 100 kg of things...<br>
        Can you find the optimal set of items that is worth as much as possible but also weighs less than 100 kg?<br>
        The combined value of those item is the new hidden word.

    <p>
        You enter a room that is just piles upon piles of books.<br>
        Some books look familiar, like Jane Eyre and Gulliver's Travels.<br>
        But a lot of other books do not make any sense at all...<br>
        "Dancing Umbrellas in the Moonlight Sandwich"?<br>
        "When Clouds Become Pineapple Smoothies"?<br>
        The pages mostly contain random words...<br>
        It seems that the piles and piles of books contains real books and fake books.<br>
        You spend the next 10 years of your life compiling all the ISBN-10 codes on the books.<br>
        If you've never read a book: the ISBN-10 code is a unique identifier for a book.<br>
        It looks like this: 0881034207<br>
        You ended up storing all those ISBN-10 codes into the `isbn.rds` file.<br>
        Now, your job is to find how many ISBN-10 codes are actually real.<br>
        Look at Wikipedia to see how to find real ISBN-10 codes:<br>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN#ISBN-10_check_digits<br>
        The number of real ISBN-10 codes is the new hidden word.

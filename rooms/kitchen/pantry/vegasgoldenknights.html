    <p>
        Those Vegas Golden Knights... they're so good...<br>
        But that was easy, I gave you the data.<br>
        Let's see how well you can process data!<br>
        Open `raw_matches.rds`.<br>
        Each row contains two teams, and whether the first team won, lost, or it was a draw.<br>
        Process all the results.<br>
        Assign 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.<br>
        Which team won the most?<br>
        That team (lower case, no spaces) + their point total is the new hidden word.<br>
        For example: "supersanders24".<br>
        (I used a random number generator for this, so don't blame me for who wins...)

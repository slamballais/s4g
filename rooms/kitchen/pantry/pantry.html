        A wall full of Stanley cups.<br>
        Clearly, this house belongs to a sociopath.<br>
        There's only one real Stanley cup, and that's the trophy for the NHL playoff champions.<br>
        So, let's look for the best team that we can.<br>
        Load the `nhl_playoffs.rds` file.<br>
        Find the team that has, on average (of all the years they played), the highest positive goal differential.<br>
        That team name (lower case, remove spaces) is your hidden word.

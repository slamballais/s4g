    <p>
        Time to do some archery.<br>
        You are going to shoot 30 arrows.<br>
        You can score by being as close to the center as possible:<br>
        * ≤ 10 cm: 10000 points<br>
        * ≤ 20 cm: 4000 points<br>
        * ≤ 30 cm: 260 points<br>
        * ≤ 40 cm: 80 points<br>
        * > 40 cm: 10 points<br><br>
        
        Yeah... I don't know who came up with that score scheme, but anyway.<br>
        And... there we go... Good luck!<br><br>
        
        Wow... ok... you realise that the target is way over there, right?<br>
        Hmm...<br>
        Well, some people just weren't born for this, I guess.<br><br>
        
        Alright, I stored all your arrow locations in the file `archery_match.rds`.<br>
        I basically tracked all the X and Y positions of your arrows in centimeters, where X=0 and Y=0 is the center.<br>
        So your first arrow was 5.4 cm centimeter to the right, and 48.8 centimeter above the target.<br>
        Not even close, LOL! <br>
        Anyway, your goal is to calculate the distance of each arrow to the center, which gives you the number of points.<br>
        From there, calculate your total number of points.<br>
        The total score is the hidden word.

    <p>
        Time to do some archery.<br>
        Each round consists of 3 arrows.<br>
        You can score by being as close to the center as possible:<br>
        * ≤ 10 cm: 100 points<br>
        * ≤ 20 cm: 80 points<br>
        * ≤ 30 cm: 60 points<br>
        * ≤ 40 cm: 40 points<br>
        * > 40 cm: no points<br><br>
        
        Load the file `archery_match.rds`.<br>
        It contains a list, where each element is a player.<br>
        Each player gets to play 30 rounds, so each element contains a list of length 30.<br>
        Each of THOSE elements contains a list of three vectors, one per arrow.<br>
        Each vector contains the X and Y coordinates of where the arrow landed (0,0 being the center of the board).<br>
        So, to grab the X-Y coordinates of the 2nd arrow of the 18th round of player 7, we do archery[[7]][[18]][[2]].<br>
        For each round, calculate the scores per arrow, and sum them together.<br>
        For each player, find the round with the highest score.<br>
        To get the hidden word, sum up all the highest scores (1 per player).

        "Alright! It's time to grow some crops!<br>
        Make a 25-by-25 matrix using `matrix()`. This is your plot of land.<br>
        Now, follow the instructions in `plant_instructions.rds`.<br>
        The first instruction says you have to move 2 rows and 5 columns.<br>
        So, you plant a crop on that position (2,5).<br>
        The next instruction says you move 0 rows and 1 column from where you are.<br>
        So, you plant a crop on that position (2,6).<br>
        And so on, and so on, until all instructions have been performed.<br>
        By the end, your crops will take the shape of an animal!<br>
        The name of the animal is the next hidden word."<br>
        
        So... drawing with crops, huh? Sounds neat!

    <p>
        You enter a room and find a singular note, right in the middle.<br>
        It explains how you should build the combined key of the kitchen.<br>
        Basically, there are four keys that are ordered.<br>
        They are obtained from the oven (1), the fire alarm (2), the kitchen drawer (3), and the pantry (4).<br>
        Each of those contain song lyrics. For each, you should grab the 10th word (lower case).<br>
        To use the key, paste the four words behind each other, and place them at the end of the URL of a room that requires a combined key.<br>
        Keep in mind, though... There are multiple rooms that require combined keys.<br>
        So, this key may not work where you think it will...

    <p>
        You blink and look around, trying to make sense of your surroundings. <br>
        You’re in a living room of a mysterious apartment, surrounded by your fellow GiS students. <br>
        How did you all get here? <br><br>
      
        Peering out the window, you gasp—you’re high up in a skyscraper! <br>
        The city below is a lifeless maze, an eerie silence hanging in the air. <br>
        It suddenly hits you: you’ve entered an alternate reality, a bizarre figment of someone’s imagination. <br><br>
      
        Suddenly, a booming voice echoes: <br><br>
      
        "Welcome, dear students, to the final challenge! <br>
        Your mission is simple: find the elusive password and tell Sander. <br>
        Succeed, and you’ll earn untold riches. <br>
        Fail, and you’ll vanish into this void, leaving empty-handed. <br>
        Puzzles are hidden throughout this apartment and beyond. <br>
        Explore freely, but hurry! Time is ticking. <br>
        Team up to solve the puzzles faster... if you dare!" <br>

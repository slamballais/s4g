      As you fight off the alien dinosaurs, you stumble into the final chamber.<br>
      Your pulse racing. This is it. You are getting out.<br>
      A talking green sofa? A ten-legged dragon? An army of duck-sized horses?<br>
      You fought, you laughed, you questioned reality itself.<br>
      But here you are, standing at the edge of ultimate knowledge.<br>
      Theyâ€™ll write songs about you.<br>
      Future students will whisper your name in awe.<br><br>
      
      You hold out your golden sword towards the final crystal.<br>
      "Jeez, they really send out anyone these days, huh?"<br>
      The crystal's snarky remark doesn't phase you in any way.<br>
      You place it next to the other crystals.<br>
      The sword starts to vibrate, and breaks into a million smaller pieces.<br>
      As the pieces fall off your hands, you're left with a small, metal cube.<br>
      It seems to have a lid.<br><br>
      Are you ready to open it?<br>

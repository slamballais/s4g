    <p>
        You push open the door and step into... the hallway.<br>
        Freedom? Hardly.<br>
        Instead, you find yourself face-to-face with a blank wall, no exit in sight.<br><br>
    
        So, you thought you’d cracked it, huh? Took a wild guess, did you?<br>
        Thought you’d outsmarted this place? Well, aren’t you clever.<br><br>
    
        Nice try, but it seems you’ve hit a dead end. <br>
        Better luck next time, smart-ass.<br>

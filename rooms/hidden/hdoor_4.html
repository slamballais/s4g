    <p>
        The sky above is torn apart, splitting open as fire rains down like the final judgment.<br>
        In the distance, you hear the wailing of the forsaken, their cries mingling with the deafening silence that comes just before the world ends.<br>
        Out of the mist, they emergeâ€”four shadowy figures atop beasts of ruin, their eyes gleaming with the fury of the end times.<br>
        The ground trembles beneath their hooves as they ride forward, bringing with them the weight of pestilence, war, famine, and death, each more terrifying than the last.<br>
        Judgment has arrived, and none will be spared.<br><br>
        
        "Mortal, do you really believe you stand a chance?<br>
        So be it.<br>
        Here is the key, you can use it directly as a key.<br>
        Realise that the key is six letters long.<br>
        And keep in mind it is beyond your plane of existence."<br>

    <p>
        After hours in the elevator, you arrive at your destination: the basement.<br>
        It's not your typical, human basement.<br>
        A thick, dense mist covers all surfaces, glowing with a pulsating, deep red light that seems to throb with life.<br>
        The floor feels soft beneath your feet, like stepping on layers of forgotten memories, or perhaps long-decayed remnants of those who came before you.<br>
        You hear thousands of screams of agony, although it is impossible to say where they come from.<br>
        The air itself is suffocating, heavy with despair, as if every breath pulls you deeper into a madness you didn’t know you carried.<br>
        Strange shapes writhe in the corners of your vision, only to vanish when you turn to face them.<br>
        Above you, the sky twists in unnatural spirals, pulling all light into a yawning void at its center—an abyss that watches, waiting.<br>
        As you walk further, the sound of whispers grows louder.<br>
        They speak in tongues forgotten by time, but the message is clear in your mind:<br><br>
        You should not be here.<br><br>
        Yet, you cannot turn back. <br>
        You feel it, don't you? <br>
        The pull of something beyond fear, beyond reason.<br>
        Something ancient and unfathomable that has waited for you to arrive.<br>
        Your heart pounds faster as the ground trembles beneath you.<br>
        It's not the earth, but the very fabric of reality, unraveling as you move deeper into this hellish underworld.<br>
        Four doors materialize from the mist, each one more twisted and grotesque than the last.<br>
        Each door contains a puzzle, but these aren't meant to be solved by you... they exist to break you.<br>
        As the whispers grow more intense, you slowly start to realise that this is as far as you may get.<br>

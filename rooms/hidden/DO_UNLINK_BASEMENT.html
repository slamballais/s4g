    <p>
        Well, you love a dramatic exit, don't you? <br>
        You are standing in the elevator again.<br>
        This time, the floor is gone, and you're floating in the air.<br>
        Below you is the infinite expanse of space.<br>
        Where once was the basement, there is now a black hole.<br>
        Neat.<br><br>
        
        As the black hole grows, the oppressive weight that once crushed your spirit begins to lift.<br>
        The screams and whispers that haunted you fade, drawn into the endless void, leaving only silence in their wake.<br>
        The thick mist, the twisted reality, and even the Horsemen themselves are consumed, unraveling like they never existed.<br>
        For the first time since entering this forsaken place, you feel an overwhelming sense of release, as though every dark presence that clung to you is being pulled away, freeing you from the depths of despair.<br><br>
        
        It is time to delete this game forever.<br>
        Look at the key that you used to get to the gamemaker.<br>
        Replace the very last word in that key with the name of the room where the game started.

    "SNORLAX"!<br>
    It's a Snorlax chair... I think he is trying to tell you what the next hidden word is.<br>
    "SNOORRRLAXXXX"!<br>
    Ok, that's not useful. Let's grab our pokedex to see what he is trying to say:<br><br>
    
    "If you load the hamming.txt file, you will see two very long strings of DNA."<br>
    "You have to calculate their Hamming distance."<br>
    "The resulting number is the new hidden word."<br>

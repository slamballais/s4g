    "Oh man, you finally woke up."<br><br>
    
    <strong>Wh-what? Who are you? Why are you in a Snorlax costume?</strong><br><br>
    
    "Wake up man, pokemon aren't real. It's all just one big illusion."<br><br>
    
    <strong>What do you mean?</strong><br><br>
    
    "They make you BELIEVE pokemon are real, but all pokemon are just hired actors!"<br><br>
    
    <strong>... Ok yeah, that explains a lot.</strong><br><br>
    
    "Right?? Ok, we have to get you to the next room, so you can expose the illuminati."<br><br>
    
    <strong>I don't thin-</strong><br><br>
    
    "So, to find the next hidden word, all you have to do is write code that determines whether a number is a leap year.<br>
    Remember that a leap year occurs every 4 years, e.g., 2024, 2028, 2032 are leap years.<br>
    However, if the number is a whole century, then it's NOT a leap year, e.g., 1900, 2000, 2100 are not leap years.<br>
    HOWEVER, if the number is divisible by four centuries, then it is! So, 400, 800, and 1200 are leap years.<br>
    Apply your code to the years written in leaps.rds.<br>
    Count how many leap years there are in the file; that is your new hidden word."<br>

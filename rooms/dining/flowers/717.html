    <p>
        You found yourself in a Boeing 717.<br>
        Not just that... you're the pilot.<br>
        And there is no one else around.<br>
        Oh dear.<br><br>
        
        To make matters worse, you hear an alarm going off.<br>
        You look around on the dashboard, and-<br>
        The 'Fuel Quantity' light is burning orange.<br>
        It seems like we have to make a landing...<br><br>
        
        Quick, load in `landing.rds`.<br>
        It contains a matrix of size 99 by 99.<br>
        Right now, you are aiming at square [50, 50], the exact middle.<br>
        But if you land here, you will fall into the void.<br>
        We have to land in the exact right square in order to go to the next room...<br><br>
        
        Luckily, we have another file: `landing_instructions.rds`.<br>
        It contains a set of 250 instructions that you need to follow.<br>
        They all consist of up, down, left, or right, followed by a number.<br>
        For example, "up 8" means that you have to move from [50, 50] to [42, 50].<br>
        If you then see "left 5" and "down 3", we would end up at [42, 45] and then [45, 45].<br>
        Process all the 250 instructions to find the final square.<br>
        The value in that square is the new hidden word.

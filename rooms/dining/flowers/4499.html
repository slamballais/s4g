    <p>
        It's time for some BINGO!<br>
        Grab a card! Load in `bingo_card.rds`!<br>
        The numbers in this bingo game go from 11 to 9999!<br>
        So, we draw all 9989 balls... in a random order.<br>
        The balls are available in `bingo_sequence.rds`.<br>
        You get a BINGO if all the numbers on your card have been drawn.<br>
        After how many balls did all your numbers get drawn?<br>
        That number is the new hidden word.

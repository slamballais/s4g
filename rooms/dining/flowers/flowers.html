    <p>
        Someone bought flowers, how nice.<br>
        You look around on the table and find a logbook.<br>
        It's just a bunch of numbers in a row.<br>
        It seems that each number is the number of euros spend on some item.<br>
        Each shopping session (where multiple items were bought) are grouped together.<br>
        The shopping sessions are separated out by NAs.<br>
        For example, if the logbook said: 10, 7, 12, NA, 8, 9, then there were two sessions.<br>
        In the first session, three items were bought for 10 + 7 + 12 = 29 euros in total.<br>
        In the second session, two items were bought for 8 + 9 = 17 euros in total.<br>
        The entire logbook that you found is stored in `shopping.rds`.<br>
        Load it in. Your goal is to find the session where the most money was spend in one session.<br>
        The amount of money that was spend in that session is the new hidden word.

    <p>
        ... TRUMP??<br>
        "Welcome, folks! You’ve stumbled into the one and only Trump Room! <br> 
        Here’s the deal: we’re building a fantastic wall—<br>
        one of the greatest walls you've ever seen—to keep you out! <br> 
        And let me tell you, nobody builds walls better than me! Believe me."<br><br>
        But... We want to get OUT of the room... Not in...<br><br>
        "Wait a second! You want to get out? What a tremendous idea! <br> 
        Yes, keep you out of the room—great plan, truly! <br> 
        But my walls are unclimbable, they say no one has ever climbed that high.<br>
        So you are stuck in the room.<br>
        But listen, I have the biggest challenge, the best challenge, that has ever existed! <br> 
        People are saying it’s the most incredible challenge they’ve ever seen! <br> 
        It’s going to be huge! <br> 
        You’ll have to solve this to get past the wall and back into the world. <br> 
        Many people think they can do it, and they tried, but they all failed. <br> 
        Not me, I climb this wall every day. But you will fail.<br>
        It's going to take all your skills, and believe me, it won’t be easy. <br>
        It will be like 2016, when everyone thought I was going to lose.<br>
        But I didn't lose, Crooked Hillary did, and everyone was embarrassed.<br>
        But then they did it again! In 2020 they said I couldn't win.<br>
        But I got more votes than any other candidate ever, even Hillary in 2016.<br>
        I won bigly.<br>
        And to get over the wall, we need a car that wins bigly too.<br>
        So open the mtcars dataset. It is in R already.<br>
        And we need to find the car that is underestimated the most!<br>
        You know, they said that Crooked Hillary had a 99% chance of winning.<br>
        But here I am. And where is Hillary? Where are her emails now?<br>
        Ok, so run a linear regression with `mpg` as the outcome and all the other variables as predictors.<br>
        You'll find many p-values, but none smaller than 1%, so none as "unlikely" as me winning in 2016.<br>
        Now, find the car with the biggest positive residual.<br>
        This is the car that people believe to have a very small mpg.<br>
        They said that same thing about me, that I have small hands.<br>
        Look at those hands. Are they small hands?<br>
        And Rubio referred to my hands if they're small, something else must be small.<br>
        I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you.<br>
        So, find that underestimated car that wins so bigly.<br>
        Find the of that car. It's so strong, everyone says so.<br>
        They say it's almost as if it runs on nuclear energy.<br>
        Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; <br>
        good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — <br>
        you know, if you're a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, <br>
        OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — <br>
        it's true! — but when you're a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — <br>
        that's why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — <br>
        you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we're a little disadvantaged — <br>
        but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — <br>
        it would have been so easy, and it's not as important as these lives are — <br>
        nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; <br>
        he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — <br>
        but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it's four — <br>
        but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; <br>
        fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven't figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, <br>
        so, you know, it's gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, <br>
        the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible. <br>
        Anyway, take the car name, all lowercase and removing the spaces, and use it in the URL.<br>
        If you do this, you will climb over the wall. I do it all the time.<br>
        I really do, people don't believe me, but it's true.<br>
        But with a car like this, you will quickly get over it, for sure.<br>
        It is not an expensive car. But it's a good car.<br>
        It used to be an American car, can you believe that?<br>
        But Laffin' Kamala destroyed the auto industry. It's true, it's true.<br>
        She also drove up the prices. Everything is expensive now.<br>
        You know, 86% of the country feels like we're on the wrong track.<br>
        Can you you imagine? 86% record of the country feels that we’re on the wrong track. <br>
        Doesn’t that tell you something? It tells you we got a problem. <br>
        I actually worry about the next three months. I really do. <br>
        I worry about the next three and a half, four months. <br>
        We’ll end up in a World War because of the people that we have. <br>
        And if you’re on the wrong track by that amount, <br>
        how can you keep someone who has stated plainly and clearly that she would do nothing, she’d do nothing from Biden? <br>
        With your vote, I will act with urgency and speed to save America and to rescue the people of California from Kamala Harris’s atrocious failures.<br>
        I will very quickly deflate… We are going to take inflation and we are going to deflate it. <br>
        We are going to deflate inflation. We are going to defeat inflation. <br>
        We’re going to knock the hell out of inflation. <br>
        We’re going to use a thing that we have more of than anybody else, it’s called liquid gold, oil and gas. <br>
        And we’re going to make America affordable again. <br>
        For all of the working people struggling under the highest taxed state in the nation, we will have large tax cuts. <br>
        We’re going to give large tax cuts for workers, and we will… Ready? <br>
        No tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. None.<br>
        By contrast, Kamala is known as the taxing queen. <br>
        The only election I’ve ever seen where they say, “We’re going to raise your taxes. <br>
        Vote from me, I’m going to raise your taxes by 72% or something,” and they’re going to end the Trump tax cuts. <br>
        I gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of our country, larger than the Reagan tax cuts. <br>
        They’re going to end them, add that to it. Her plan will raise taxes for the typical American family by more than $3,000 a year.<br>
        In Detroit two days ago, I also announced that we will make interest on car loans fully deductible because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream. <br>
        We’ve lost the American dream in this country. <br>
        We have lost it for our young people. <br>
        They want the American dream. <br>
        They want to have a great life like Elon Musk. They like his life.<br>
        How good was he the other night? Did you see him? He was so happy. <br>
        He lives a reclusive life, the life of a super genius. But he’s rather dark MAGA. <br>
        That’s right. He’s a different kind of a guy. He’s great. He sees a hat. <br>
        I didn’t even know we made them. It’s all black with black letters. That’s called very subtle, right? <br>
        You hardly even see Make America Great Again. He fell in love with it and he wore it. <br>
        I don’t think he’s taken it off in weeks. He wore it. <br>
        And I said, “What is that?” He said, “It’s dark MAGA.” <br>
        I said, “Elon. That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.”<br>
        Anyway, he gave us the best endorsement. He endorsed me a few months ago. <br>
        He said, “If Trump doesn’t win, it’s probably the end of our country.” <br>
        He means that too, by the way. He means that. And you know where he is today? <br>
        He’s campaigning in Pennsylvania for me. That’s how good… He feels it’s so important. <br>
        And I really think we won’t have a country left. Elon… Oh, he’ll be…<br>
        He’s a great guy. But really, I got involved last week because as you know, <br>
        Biden and Harris have done a horrible job on North Carolina and some of the other ones, <br>
        in particular the first of the hurricanes that came in. It really wiped out North Carolina. <br>
        And a person called, a person I know, an official in North Carolina and says, <br>
        “Sir, we’re wiped out here. All our lines are down. We have no power. We have absolutely no communication.” <br>
        It became to the mainland. What happened is the water was so high, it created… They were literally landlocked. <br>
        And he said, “Do you know Elon Musk?” And I said, “Yeah, I do. What do you need?” <br>
        He said, “We need Starlink.” I said, “What the hell is Starlink?” True. <br>
        I said, “Elon, what the hell is Starlink?” No. I said, “What is Starlink?” <br>
        He said, “Communication. Very good communication.” <br>
        So I called Elon. I said, “Elon, they’re in big trouble in North Carolina. They need Starlink and you guys…” <br>
        They’re doing so well with it. It’s a very hard thing to get. <br>
        So I said, “You guys, is there anything you can do?” <br>
        In the meantime, my phone rings and it’s the guy from North Carolina thanking me and I’m still on the phone with Elon. <br>
        I said, “Elon, what the hell did you do? You told them that you’ve got it before I even hung up.” <br>
        So he’s on a different planet than us, right? He said, “Yeah.” He said, “Yeah, you were talking and I was going…” Whatever.<br>
        And he got it. He got them a lot of it. He got it… And I said to the people, “What’s better, that or the hard line?”<br>
        He said, “Actually, Starlink is better. Starlink is better.” But he’s a great guy and he’s done a great job. <br>
        And it’s too bad that Kamala didn’t do… I don’t even know she… She’s essentially not even gone there essentially.<br>
        But what happened in North Carolina and then Ron DeSantis, who’s done a very good job in Florida, he didn’t want her even involved.<br>
        He was dealing with Biden. He didn’t want her involved.<br>
        I will also cancel Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate. Isn’t it crazy? <br>
        You guys, you have brownouts, blackouts. California’s brownouts and blackouts every weekend, every day. <br>
        And now she says, “Let’s go all electric cars.” These people are crazy. And the thing is that… And they’re great. <br>
        I like electric, but they’re for a certain market. The amazing thing with Elon? He makes the Tesla. <br>
        And he’s a friend of mine. He has never called up and said, “Would you do me a favor? Would you lay the hell off the electric car?”<br>
        Because he understands. He’s got a great market. It’s a smart market. It’s a more expensive car. <br>
        It’s got some great things and some assets, but you also have to let gas propelled, gasoline propelled cars in and hybrids in.<br>
        They have another one now. You ever hear about the hydrogen? It’s hydrogen. The problem with hydrogen, has one fault.<br>
        Somebody says it’s better than everything. Got one fault. If it blows up, you’re not recognizable.<br>
        It’s true. In other words, it doesn’t happen much, maybe once a day in the nation, if the hydrogen car blows up, it’s gone.<br>
        You’re gone. Your wife looks at a tree and there’s nothing but blood on the tree.<br>
        She said, “I just can’t tell. Is that my husband?”<br>
        No, these are serious problems. They wanted to give me one. I said, “No thanks. I don’t want one.” <br>
        No, I’ll take electric. But isn’t that something? Elon never called up. But he never said that. <br>
        Swore to you he never said it. And he said… whereas Biden would say, “Oh no, I’m not kidding.” <br>
        You remember when he’d say, “Yes, we’ve been threatened with war by Russia.” No, no, I’m not joking.<br>
        He always says, “I’m not joking about the…” No, no, I’m not joking. I don’t know if anybody understands that. <br>
        But he’s a weird dude, I’ll tell you. They called JD Vance and me weird. <br>
        How about the vice president, her and Biden, the combination.<br>
        But by the way, how good a job did JD Vance do the other night? Our JD.<br>
        I shouldn’t say it, but I took him in because he has a very good brain. We like smart people. <br>
        He’s very smart. He was a top, top student at Ohio State. He finished in two years, top of his class.<br>
        And then I didn’t know you could do that actually, but he finished two years. <br>
        Then he went to the military, was outstanding in the military. <br>
        Then he came out, he went to Yale Law School and he and his wife were like top, top students.<br>
        And I sort of picked him a little bit for the brain.<br>
        We had a lot of great people. We have a lot of great people that were in that group and any one of them would’ve been fantastic.<br>
        But JD did a great job the other night. <br>
        The guy that he went against, you ever hear a guy call himself a knucklehead and he’s in a debate? He’s the biggest liar. <br>
        He lied about everything. And how come he went to China 28 times? What’s going on? He went to China.<br>
        Nobody asked him that one question. I kept saying, “Somebody ask him the question, why was he in China 28 times?”<br>
        There’s a guy that’s got some problems. By the way, if you think she’s all right, she’s not.<br>
        I think she’s worse than him too, actually. But he went to China 28 times and I’m waiting for somebody to ask him that question.<br>
        It won’t be the fake news, I can tell you that. It won’t be those people.<br>
        And I will not allow California politicians to get away with their plan to impose a 100% ban on the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks in your state.<br>
        Not going to let it… That’ll be ended in the first day.<br>
        That’ll be ended. These people, it’s unbelievable. <br>
        To bring jobs, factories, and wealth racing back to our shores, we will have a 15% made in America corporate tax rate.<br>
        In other words, you have to make your product in America. Then you have only 15. <br>
        Remember, I brought it down to 21% from almost 40%. Everyone said, “There’s no way you’ll be able to.” <br>
        I had to get it passed in Congress. Could you believe it?<br>
        Again, it’s the greatest tax cut, the biggest tax cut and regulation cuts, the most regulations ever cut by a president by, <br>
        I think three or four times actually, which I think is actually more important. <br>
        I asked a lot of the big executives of the biggest companies, what was more important, the tax cut where we took them from almost 40% to 21% or the regulation cuts?<br>
        Every single one of them said the regulation cuts, which actually surprised me, but it was the regulation. But I got you down to 21.<br>
        And 21 is highly competitive with other countries. We’re dealing with other countries because they’ll take our businesses in two seconds. <br>
        It’s not like, “Oh gee, you’re not going to give them and they’re going to sit still.” They don’t care about our country. <br>
        Many of them aren’t even from America. They’re not from the U.S. They’re international business people. Very smart. <br>
        And they will leave here in two seconds if they can get something substantially. So I came up with this idea. <br>
        So now I have you at 21, brought you all the way down and I said, “If you make your product here, you don’t have to pay 21, you can pay 15.” <br>
        And people called me from all over the planet. I got calls from the top guys on the Wall Street, “Who the hell gave you that idea? That’s so good.”<br>
        And I oftentimes say it’s like the paper clip. Somebody came up with the idea for a paper clip a hundred years ago. <br>
        They look at it and everybody looked at it and said, ” Why the hell didn’t I think of that?” It’s like the same thing. <br>
        And for those who don’t make their product in America, they’ll be forced to pay stiff tariffs for the privilege of competing with our cherished companies and stealing our jobs, our treasure, our wealth.<br>
        And we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs to the benefit of American citizens and pay off debt or we’re going to take care of our… We owe $35 trillion.<br>
        We’re going to start cutting it down very quickly. We’ll be able to with growth. We call it growth, but we’re going to do that. We’re going to protect these companies with tariffs.<br>
        Remember this, in many years, many decades, China never paid 10 cents. And what they did to our country was incredible.<br>
        I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from China. I don’t think they liked me, but actually, I liked them.<br>
        And we actually had a very good relationship, President Xi and myself. Somebody said, “What kind of a man is he?” He’s a fierce person.<br>
        He is. He’s a very smart guy. I hate to say brilliant because every time I call him brilliant, the press said, “You said the president…”<br>
        Well, he is a brilliant guy. Got 1.4 billion people. He rules it with an iron fist and the press gets upset when I say he’s a smart man.<br>
        I would think he’s a smart man, but actually, he’s somebody that we can… The worst people are the enemies from within,<br>
        the sleaze bags like the guy that you’re going to elect to the Senate, Shifty Adam Schiff. He’s a sleaze bag.<br>
        This guy… No, no, he’s a major low life. And because of the fact that they send millions and millions of ballots someplace, <br>
        they send them all over the place, California, you don’t have anything like a voting booth. They take ballots, they just send them all over the place.<br>
        They come back and they say, “Oh, somebody won by five million votes.” And it’s so corrupt, so corrupt.<br>
        But you’re going to have Shifty Adam Schiff, one of the true… I know him well because he conceived of the Russia hoax, the Russia, Russia hoax.<br>
        He is a bad person. He’s a sick person, not a stupid guy, but he’s a sick puppy that guy.<br>
        One of the least… I’m not allowed to say this because this could cost you your president because you’re not supposed to talk about somebody’s looks, and so I won’t.<br>
        But to me, he’s one of the least attractive human beings I think I’ve ever seen. Not a stupid person. He’s got the smallest neck I’ve ever seen.<br>
        No, he’s got the smallest neck. His neck is so small and his head is large, so he’s not being held up by much.<br>
        I can guarantee you, he will not be playing for your local football team, I guarantee.<br>
        But we’re pleased to be joined today by some incredible people and friends of mine and warriors, real warriors, Representatives Darrell Issa.<br>
        Where’s Darrell? Is he here? Darrell? He’s a great guy. Matt Gaetz. Is Matt Gaetz… Oh, look at Matt Gaetz. He’s a great guy.<br>
        He’s really a great person. And he’s on the controversial side, but that’s not bad. And is he here with Ginger? He’s here with Ginger.<br>
        Hi Ginger. And Ken Calvert, and he is here someplace. Where’s Ken? Ken, thank you. Good job, Ken. Very good job. Do we have enough people for you guys?<br>
        Do we have enough? Broke the record.<br>
        There’s Mr. Tom Barrack. I didn’t recognize him with that hat on. Look at him. Stand up, Tom. Great guy. Great businessman, actually. <br>
        He’s a great businessman. But everybody needs to get out and vote for Ken, who’s running right now. A radical California liberal is running against him.<br>
        And I gave him a very strong endorsement. I put it out on Truth a little while ago. You saw that.<br>
        And I want to mention, I heard you were here and I want to mention, so good luck. Get out and vote for Ken Calvert, everybody.<br>
        We also have members of our great Native American tribes. They’re fantastic people. We have the chiefs. We have… Where are they?<br>
        They’re here. Where are they? They’re phenomenal people and they’re doing a beautiful job. They’re great. <br>
        And we also have a lot of farmers here today. We do very well with the farmers. <br>
        But the farmers are having a little rough spot because Biden and Kamala are not doing their job. I never use the word Harris.<br>
        If I say Harris, nobody knows who the hell I’m talking about. I say, “Harris is doing a terrible job.” And they go, “Who the hell is Harris?”<br>
        It’s a funny name. It’s a name, you know what I’m talking about, Tom? It’s a name that nobody knows what the hell I’m talking about.So I call her Kamala.<br>
        We also have a really great governor, governor that I’ve gotten to know really well in the last six, seven months.<br>
        And he’s doing a terrific job, Spencer Cox of Utah, and he’s here someplace. It’s a big crowd. He’s here someplace amongst a hundred thousand people.<br>
        Former National Security Advisor, Robert O’Brien. Good man. Thank you, Robert.<br>
        And Robert went out and got all of the top people in government, 300 and something of them, more than 300, <br>
        and he went out and got them all and they all came in the last couple of days and endorsed Trump.<br>
        They said, “Trump is the greatest president we’ve ever had.” 300… The top… We only had one problem, Matt. <br>
        The press refused to cover it, Robert, all that work. But we had 300 of the top people in the country.<br>
        In fact, people that didn’t even like me totally said, “He’s great. I don’t like him. But man, was he good.”<br>
        Because I protected our country. And that was great. But the press hasn’t picked it up too much.<br>
        I’ll have to give it to Matt Gaetz. Robert, give him the list.<br>
        If that were Kamala, they’d make it headlines with Trump 300, much more than they had. <br>
        And these are much better people than they had too, that I can tell you. Because remember this, I kept your country safe.<br>
        We had no wars, and I’ll keep you out of wars. But we did have one, which I had to finish up, ISIS.<br>
        It was supposed to take five years, but it took me two months.<br>
        We also have a man who’s a really fantastic person. He’s really great. Did an unbelievable job on lots of things.<br>
        He actually started off as the ambassador to Germany. And the greatest day in Angela Merkel’s life was the day I took him out to promote him.<br>
        She said, “Oh my God, thank you.” He drove Angela crazy and that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. His name is Rick Grenell.<br>
        Thank you, Rick. And he did a fantastic… And Kash Patel is here, one of our real warriors, a real warrior,<br>
        and also somebody that’s doing a beautiful job out here, even though, sadly,<br>
        when you’ve sent out 38 million ballots and just send them out, they come back, what the hell?<br>
        We’re going to have to work on that when we get in. We’re going to have to work on elections.<br>
        We need borders, and we need fair elections, and we’re going to work on it. <br>
        But she is doing a great job, and she says I’m setting all sorts of records, GOP Chair, California, Jessica Patterson. <br>
        Jessica, thank you very much. Thank you. Great job. Just really good job. Somebody else who was so fantastic today. <br>
        He’s tough. And he had the most beautiful family I’ve ever seen. Everybody’s like a perfect specimen. <br>
        I said, “Sheriff, you’re great, but your family looks even better than you.” <br>
        And I liked him from the moment I met him and I talked to him a little bit. <br>
        Because this was not an easy one to pull off, let me tell you. We had a lot more people than some people thought.<br>
        A lot of people thought this was what you’re going to have, but a lot of people said maybe you’d have 10,000, maybe 20,000, but they didn’t say 100,000.<br>
        But he pulled it off, and he pulled it off because he’s tough, and he’s smart, and he’s proud of his state and his country.<br>
        Chad Bianco. Thank you, Chad. He is like central casting. Thank you, Chad.<br>
        What a family, though. Look at the family. Thank you, thank you both. Great.<br>
        Another man, he wrote a song it went to number one on all the lists, you saw it. We put it … That’s right.<br>
        He said Tom McDonald, he’s Tom McDonald. Tom? Where’s Tom? Thank you, Tom. That’s a great song, too, I was honored by it.<br>
        He did the song, and I didn’t know Tom as well as others and now I know him very well, <br>
        but he did the song and it went to number one on every single list.<br>
        And another man is here, and I thought the movie was great. Dennis Quaid is here with his brother, Randy Quaid. Two very good guys.<br>
        That movie was great. Ronald Reagan. Did you like him, did you like Reagan? You liked him. He liked Reagan.<br>
        He liked Reagan. I think you have to like him to play him that way. You did a beautiful job, thank you.<br>
        And a very rich guy. He owns this piece of land, and he’s been after me for three years.<br>
        “Please use it, just use it. We love you, sir.” He’s an unbelievable patriot, an unbelievable Republican. But you know what? <br>
        That’s less important, he loves our country. Al and Betty, we have to say, Hagen. Where’s Al Hagen? Where is Al? Al Hagen.<br>
        And Steve Hilton is here, who’s been on television doing a fantastic job, where’s Steve? Where is Steve? He’s around. <br>
        And we have a lot of other people. We have a lot of Congressmen, we have some Senators, but I’ve had it. That’s enough of this stuff.<br>
        But I also want to send our love to all of the people back East who are recovering from two really devastating storms, hurricanes.<br>
        Our hearts are with those who lost a loved one or a home and that was a rough one, God bless them all.<br>
        Kamala Harris is grossly incompetent. She didn’t do a good job. She didn’t do a good job. She’s got to do a good job, and she didn’t.<br>
        But the most radical Left Vice President in American history, that’s what she’s known for.<br>
        She did so bad in so many different ways, and we’re going to get onto a much more pleasant subject, it’s called the revitalization of our country.<br>
        We have a situation in our country where we’re not going to let people continue to destroy it.<br>
        California has been horribly mismanaged. Nothing has been managed worse than water. Do you know water? It sounds simple. <br>
        Oh, water, what the hell is water? I was with Devin Nunes. Did anyone ever hear of Devin Nunes? He was brave. <br>
        He got big awards for what he did, he’s very brave. He’s the one that figured out the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax with Jim Jordan, the great Jim Jordan.<br>
        Two great guys. He’s now running Truth and doing a very good job. Truth, get on to Truth.<br>
        But Devin, I’m riding up California and we’re going up toward the north and we look at this land.<br>
        I said, “Why is it all so barren? And then right in the middle of it you have this little green spot that’s so beautiful, so vibrant.”<br>
        He said, “Because they have no water.” I said, “Oh, I didn’t know you had a drought. <br>
        Do you have a drought?” “No. We take all of our water way up north and we route into the Pacific Ocean.<br>
        So instead of coming down to past the farms where you take the farms, you had thousands and thousands of acres that was dead bone dry.<br>
        And they tell me, farmers tell me, it’s the finest land in the country, it’s like Iowa land.<br>
        It’s the finest land in the country, but they have no water. Artificially, they reroute it because they want to save, there’s a fish, Delta smelt.<br>
        Anyone ever hear of it? And it’s not just in this area. By the way, the Delta smelt is doing extremely badly, especially since it has no water.<br>
        They think they have a fish and their way of saving the fish is not to give it water. Somehow that doesn’t work.<br>
        But you have a little Delta smelt, but you have other areas, so it’s not like to this area only.<br>
        And millions and millions of gallons of water over a short period of time gets pumped right into the Pacific Ocean.<br>
        They have a giant faucet like your sink, except a thousand times bigger. It takes one day, they turn it.<br>
        It’s a big valve it goes over and the water pours by the millions of gallons. It pours into the Pacific Ocean, which for the Pacific is like a drop.<br>
        Just like it drop. And if they turn that faucet the way it should be, it’s been that way for years. <br>
        And I went to your Governor and he said, “Well, the hard part is the Federal Government. <br>
        It was actually Department of Commerce, and I got it worked out at Department of Commerce.<br>
        Within two months everything was done. Then I went to see Gavin Newsom and I said… And, they didn’t want to do it.<br>
        They had all sorts of reasons, nonsense. They use the environment. Everybody uses the environment to stop things.<br>
        But, we’re not going to let that happen because it was toward the end and we’re not going to ever let that happen again.<br>
        You would have so much water. I read where in Beverly Hills and Bel-Air, they want bring you down to like 28 gallons a person.<br>
        That sounds like a lot. But you know what that is like about a seven-minute shower. You spend a fortune for a house and you can’t take a shower.<br>
        So, we’re going to take care of our farmers. We’re going to take care of your water situation, and we’ll force it down his throat.<br>
        And we’ll say, “Gavin, if you don’t do it, we’re not giving you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the forest fires that you have.”<br>
        It’s not hard to do. We just had so many other things to do.<br>
        I was working on two Russia hoaxes, I was working on impeachments, I was working on indictments.<br>
        They went out of their way to keep me busy, because they didn’t want this to happen. They didn’t want this.<br>
        It could have happened to nobody else, believe me.<br>
        But Devin has done a fantastic job. We are going to have, that farmland is going to be the most fertile land. <br>
        One of the farmers told me, “Sir, it’s the best land in the country. They won’t give us any water.” <br>
        I actually said, “Oh, you have a drought?” I figured they didn’t have rain. I said, “No, the opposite. <br>
        We have so much water, we don’t know what to do with it.” But they won’t let the water come down. <br>
        I think these guys actually hate our country, if you think. I think they hate our country.<br>
        With your vote this November, we are going to defeat this radical Left country destroyer, her and him, and we’re going to finish what we so brilliantly started.<br>
        We have so many different things, and yet we’re very consequential. You know how I know that? <br>
        Because only consequential Presidents get shot at. You know that? It’s true.<br>
        Biden’s got no problem sleeping on the beach. If I slept on the beach, it would last very short. <br>
        Wouldn’t be good. The Secret Service wouldn’t be too happy. Say, “Kids, I want to go to sleep on the beach.”<br>
        Who the hell sleeps in front of the paparazzi, the media? How do you sleep in front of the media? <br>
        The cameras are rolling, and he’s lazy. And you know the amazing thing? He’s out cold within two or 3 minutes. I could never do that.<br>
        I toss and turn at night. I sweat, I toss and turn thinking about things and deals.<br>
        “How am I going to get China for what they’re doing? How am I going to do this?” I toss and turn and toss and turn.<br>
        I then wake up, and then I go to work and then I go late to bed, I toss and turn. He goes to the beach. <br>
        He Lays down and he falls asleep. Within two minutes he stone-cold out. They’re always showing him in pictures, he’s stone-cold out.<br>
        I consider that actually a great ability, I’d like to have some of it. Not all of it. I’d like to have a little bit of it.<br>
        Maybe he can sell it. If he could, he would do it, I promise you.<br>
        We will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack and drill, baby drill.<br>
        And, I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. Your energy prices will be cut within 12 months.<br>
        And remember what I said, California, you’re going to have so much water, you’re not going to know what the hell to do with it.<br>
        They’re going to call me. Remember about winning when I used to do this about winning?<br>
        They’re going to call me in the White House and they’re going to say, “Sir, please, please, we have too much water.<br>
        We’re flooding. Please sir. Please, we have too much water.” Right now. You don’t have any water. Artificial. It’s artificial.<br>
        “Sir, please could we see you? We have far too much water.”<br>
        I will stop outsourcing and turn the US into a manufacturing superpower, and I will end a war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East.<br>
        And I will prevent very definitely World War III. We’re very close to World War III. Very, very close. Are they okay back there?<br>
        Take your time, doctor. Doctor, thank you. Is there a doctor? Doctor in the house? Yeah. Take your time, please.<br>
        Don’t forget, they’ve been here for two days, three days. These guys have been here for a long time, so take your time."<br>
        The doctor takes you away, so that you can finally solve the puzzle.

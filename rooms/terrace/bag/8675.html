        Impressive. Let's do some more bean counting.<br>
        We will make a vector of length 100.<br>
        The first number is 1.<br>
        The second number is (1 + 1)^2 = 4.<br>
        The third number is sqrt(4 + 4), which is roughly 2.828427.<br>
        The fourth number is (2.828427 + 2.828427)^2 = 32.<br>
        The fifth number is sqrt(32 + 32)...<br>
        Do you see the pattern?<br>
        The question is: Of how many digits does the final number consist?<br>
        That is your new hidden word.<br>

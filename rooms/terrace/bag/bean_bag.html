    <p>
        Whoops, wrong kind of bean bag.<br>
        Anyway, here's your puzzle.<br>
        Load "beans.txt".<br>
        For the 1st turn, start in element 1. It contains a number, 1017.<br>
        For the 2nd turn, you start in that element (1017). It contains 721.<br>
        For the 3rd turn, you start in element 721.<br>
        Keep repeating this process, and play for a total of 10,000 turns.<br>
        Whatever number you have after playing 10,000 turns is the new hidden word.<br>

        Awesome, I just had to make sure you were one of my GiS 2025 students.<br>
        Alright, since you guys wanted to play easy mode, here are some of the rules:<br><br>
        
        Each room that you can access contains various items:<br>
        Living room has green sofa, white sofa, etc etc etc ...<br>
        Most of those items require you to solve THREE puzzles.<br>
        Each puzzle gives you a hidden word that you can enter as the URL (after the /).<br>
        For example: statistics4genomics.com/example.<br><br>
        
        After solving all puzzles for an item (like I said, usually 3), you will be led to a key part.<br>
        When you solve all puzzles in a room, you should have all the key parts AND instructions on how to combine them.<br>
        Each room (living room, kitchen, and [dining room + terrace]) form their own key.<br>
        Hence, you end up with 3 keys that you have to combine with each other as well.<br>
        Don't worry, the instructions for that are also somewhere, and you can find instructions on how to use them.<br><br>
        
        All items are marked with stars, to indicate how difficult they are.<br>
        Most puzzles require you to use functions you haven't used before, or in ways you haven't done before.<br>
        Some puzzles (some of the 4-star ones) require you to do for-loops in for-loops.<br>
        Yeah, I didn't make it easy.<br><br>
        
        <strong>"But mister, what if we can only get 1 or 2 of the 3 keys?"</strong><br><br>
        
        Sigh, well, that's not 3 keys, is it?<br><br>
        
        Good luck!

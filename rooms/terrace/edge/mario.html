        "Yahoo! It's-a me, Mario!<br> 
        I’m-a here to help you on your quest!<br> 
        You see, the keys you get from the flowers in the dining room and the bean bag on the terrace are coordinates!<br> 
        The flowers give you the latitude (lat), and the bean bag gives you the longitude (long)!<br>
        With these coordinates, you can find the name of a special place! Just go online to one of the many converters!<br> 
        And if you use the instructions from the chairs puzzle in the dining room, you can make the magical combined key!<br> 
        You can use this key on any locked door you might find!<br> 
        Just add the combined key at the end of the URL of that locked door room!<br> 
        Good luck! So long-e, player! Let’s-a go!"

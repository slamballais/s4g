        "Yahoo! It's-a me, Mario!<br> 
        I’m-a here to help you on your quest!<br> 
        You see, the keys you get from the flowers in the dining room and the bean bag on the terrace are coordinates!<br> 
        The flowers give you the latitude (lat), and the bean bag gives you the longitude (long)!<br>
        With these coordinates, you can find the name of a special place! Just go online to one of the many converters!<br> 
        This special place is one of the DOOR KEYS, waa-hoo!<br>
        Except that you still need to do something with it, wawawawa!<br>
        Solve the chairs puzzle in the dining room to figure that out!<br>
        Good luck! So long-e, player! Let’s-a go!"
